# movie_finder

Personal hobby project for keep skills up to date and trying the Tmdb API.  
It's a work in progress, I'll be adding new UI elements and features constantly.

What's next:
- Local data handling
- Discover movies list on home page
- Login with Tmdb account
- Add movies to favorite list
- Connection check
- Bottom nav with Search and my list items
